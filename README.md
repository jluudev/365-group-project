# Description:
This API simulates a hero guild where users send out heroes on quests to slay monsters and dungeons. Dungeons will periodically spawn monsters that will need to be eliminated. Heroes will have to adventure to the dungeon and clear the dungeon (which takes a set amount of time depending on the heroes). Heroes can back out of the dungeon if they are low on health. If they fail their quest, there are consequences. The reward for clearing a dungeon is gold. The best guild is the one with the most gold.
